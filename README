Nsscash (a pun on cache) is a simple file-based cache for NSS similar to
nsscache [1]. The goal is to distribute users/groups/etc. to multiple systems
without having to rely on a (single) stable server. Traditional systems like
LDAP or NIS require a stable server or users/groups cannot be resolved. By
distributing the data to all systems, temporary outages of the server cause no
issues on the clients. In addition the local storage is much faster than
remote network access. To update the local caches polling via HTTP is
performed, for example every minute, only downloading new data if anything has
changed.

Nsscash consists of two parts: `nsscash`, written in Go, which downloads files
via HTTP or HTTPS, parses them, creates indices and writes the result to a
local file. The second part is the NSS module (`libnss_cash.so.2`), written in
C, which provides integration via `/etc/nsswitch.conf`. It's specifically
designed to be very simple and uses the prepared data for lookups. To support
quick lookups, in O(log n), the files utilize indices.
